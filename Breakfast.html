        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups maida (plain flour/refined flour)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter, melted</li>
            <li>1½ cups milk (adjust as needed)</li>
            <li>Butter for serving</li>
            <li>Honey or maple syrup for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of maida (plain flour). You can also use wheat flour (atta) for a healthier alternative.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp baking powder, ½ tsp baking soda, and a pinch of salt. Mix all the dry ingredients thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tbsp of melted butter and 1 cup of milk to the dry ingredients. Whisk the mixture until it is well combined.</li>
            <li>Add an additional ½ cup of milk, mixing it in gradually until you have a smooth, flowing batter. Adjust the consistency by adding more milk if necessary.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat. Grease the surface with a little butter.</li>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of the pancake batter onto the pan. Avoid spreading it out with a spoon; let the batter spread naturally.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 minutes or until small bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the other side is golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Serve the eggless pancakes warm with a dollop of butter and drizzle with honey or maple syrup for extra sweetness.</li>
        </ol>

            <h3>Additional Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For a fluffier texture, you can add 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the dry ingredients.</li>
                <li>If you prefer a vegan option, substitute milk with almond or soy milk and use a plant-based butter alternative.</li>
                <li>Feel free to add fruits like banana slices or berries to the batter for a fruity twist.</li>
